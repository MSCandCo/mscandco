# Supabase Email Verification Redirect Setup

## Quick Fix for Email Verification Redirect

Follow these steps to make email verification links go to your beautiful custom page instead of the generic dashboard:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
- Open your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **URL Configuration**

### 2. Update URL Configuration
Set these values:

**Site URL:**
```

```

**Redirect URLs:** (Add this to the list)
```
http://localhost:3003/email-verified
```

### 3. Update Email Templates (Optional but Recommended)
- Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Email Templates**
- Click on **Confirm signup** template
- In the email template, make sure the redirect URL is set to:
```
{{ .SiteURL }}/email-verified
```

### 4. For Production (Later)
When you deploy to staging.mscandco.com, update:
