## üìä Expected Results Summary

|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Super Admin | super_admin | SUPER ADMIN |

| Financial Admin | financial_admin | FINANCIAL ADMIN |

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Badge Not Appearing?

**Check:**
1. Is profile data loading? (Check network tab for `/api/artist/profile` call)
2. Is the role field present in profile response?
3. Are you logged in? Badge only shows for authenticated users
4. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Badge Shows Wrong Role?

**Check:**
1. Database: `SELECT email, role FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'user@example.com'`
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Logout and login again
4. Verify the profile API is returning the correct role

### Badge Not Updating After Role Change?

**Fix:**
1. Logout completely
2. Clear browser cache
3. Login again with changed user
4. Profile API should fetch new role from database
