# Test Superadmin Access - SIMPLE STEPS

## ✅ Dev server is now running with enhanced logging!

---

## 🧪 **Test Steps (Do This Now):**

### Step 1: Open Your Browser
```
http://localhost:3013
```

### Step 2: Login as Superadmin
- Email: `superadmin@mscandco.com`
- Password: (your password)

### Step 3: Try to Access an Admin Page
Click on one of these links or type in the URL bar:
- http://localhost:3013/admin/walletmanagement
- http://localhost:3013/admin/usermanagement
- http://localhost:3013/admin/platformanalytics

### Step 4: What Happens?
- ✅ **If you see the page**: Great! The issue is fixed!
- ❌ **If you get redirected to dashboard**: Come back here, I'll check the logs

---

## 📋 **For Me to Check:**

After you try accessing the page, I'll run:
```bash
# Check the dev server logs for the permission check output
```

The logs will show:
- 🔍 What user is being checked
- 🔍 What permissions they're asking for  
- ✅ How many permissions were found
- 📋 List of actual permissions
- ✅ or ❌ Whether access was granted or denied

---

## 🚨 **If Still Redirected:**

If you're still getting redirected, I'll immediately apply the **emergency bypass** that lets you access everything while we debug the root cause.

---

**Just try it now and let me know what happens!** 🚀
