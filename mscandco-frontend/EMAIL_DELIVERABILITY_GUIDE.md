# Email Deliverability & Spam Prevention Guide

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Technical Setup Complete | üìà Reputation Building Phase

---

## Current Situation

‚úÖ **Domain Verified:** `mscandco.com` is fully verified in Resend
‚úÖ **SPF/DKIM/DMARC:** All authentication records configured
‚úÖ **Unsubscribe Headers:** Added to improve compliance
‚ùå **Reputation Score:** New domain (0 sender history)

**Why Emails Go to Spam:** Your domain is technically perfect but has no sending history. This is **normal and expected** for new domains.

---

## Understanding Email Reputation

Email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) use **sender reputation** to decide inbox vs. spam placement. Think of it like a credit score for your domain.

### Your Domain's Current State:
- **Age:** Just verified (39 minutes ago in screenshot)
- **Reputation Score:** 0/100 (brand new)
- **Email Volume:** 3 test emails sent
- **Engagement:** None yet

### What Triggers Spam Filters for New Domains:
1. **Zero sending history** ‚Üê This is you right now
2. No user engagement data
3. Low email volume (looks suspicious)
4. First-time sender to recipient
5. No established pattern

## How to Fix Spam Issues (30-Day Plan)

### Week 1: Warm Up Your Domain (Critical)

**Day 1-3: Small Volume (10-20 emails/day)**
```
‚úÖ Send to known contacts who expect your emails
‚úÖ Send to different email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
‚úÖ Space out sends (don't send all at once)
‚ùå Don't send to purchased lists
‚ùå Don't send identical content repeatedly
```

**Day 4-7: Gradual Increase (50-100 emails/day)**
```
‚úÖ Monitor bounce rates (should be < 2%)
‚úÖ Check spam complaint rate (should be < 0.1%)
‚úÖ Track open rates (goal: > 15-20%)
```

### Week 2-4: Build Reputation

**Key Actions:**
1. **Consistent Sending Pattern**
   - Send emails regularly (daily or every other day)
   - Maintain similar volume patterns
   - Avoid sudden spikes in volume

2. **Engagement Signals**
   - Get recipients to open emails
   - Get clicks on links in emails
   - Get replies (even better!)
   - Get emails marked as "Not Spam"

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Bounce rate < 2%
   - Spam complaints < 0.1%
   - Unsubscribe rate < 0.5%
   - Open rate > 20%

---

## Immediate Actions (Do These Now)

### 1. Mark Test Emails as "Not Spam"
Every time you receive a test email in spam:
1. Open the email
2. Click "Not Spam" or "Report Not Spam"
3. Move it to Inbox
4. Star or label it (signals importance)

### 2. Add to Contacts
Add these to your contacts:
- `noreply@mscandco.com`
- `support@mscandco.com` (if you use it)

### 3. Engage with Your Emails
- Open every email
- Click on links
- Read the content
- Reply if there's a reply-to address

### 4. Send to Yourself First
Before sending to users:
```bash
# Test with your own email addresses
curl -X POST "https://fzqpoayhdisusgrotyfg.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-email" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "emailType": "welcome",
    "to": "your-email@example.com",
    "data": {
      "UserName": "Your Name"
    }
  }'
```

## What We've Already Done (Technical)

### ‚úÖ DNS Authentication
```
SPF:    ‚úÖ Configured (send TXT record)
DKIM:   ‚úÖ Configured (resend._domainkey TXT record)
DMARC:  ‚úÖ Configured (_dmarc TXT record)
MX:     ‚úÖ Configured (feedback SMTP)
```

### ‚úÖ Email Headers
```javascript
// Added to every email:
'List-Unsubscribe': '<mailto:unsubscribe@mscandco.com>'
'List-Unsubscribe-Post': 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click'
```
This signals to email providers that you're following best practices.

### ‚úÖ Sender Identity
```
From: MSC & Co <noreply@mscandco.com>
```
Verified domain matching your website.

### ‚úÖ Content Quality
- Professional HTML templates
- Proper text/HTML balance
- No spam trigger words
- Clear call-to-actions
- Mobile-responsive design

## Timeline: When Will Spam Issues Resolve?

| Timeframe | Expected Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Days 1-7** | Still mostly spam (20-30% inbox) |
| **Days 8-14** | Improving (40-60% inbox) |
| **Days 15-21** | Much better (70-80% inbox) |
| **Days 22-30** | Good reputation (85-95% inbox) |
| **Month 2+** | Excellent (95%+ inbox) |

**Reality Check:** Even with perfect setup, new domains need time. There's no instant fix.

## Red Flags That Hurt Reputation

‚ùå **Avoid These:**
1. Sending to purchased/scraped email lists

5. All-caps subject lines
6. Missing unsubscribe option
7. Sending from unverified domain
8. Inconsistent sending patterns
9. Low engagement (< 5% open rate)
10. High complaint rate (> 0.1%)

## Testing Best Practices

### Before Launching to Real Users

1. **Test with Multiple Providers:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Gmail (info@audiostems.co.uk)
   ‚úÖ Outlook/Hotmail (your-email@outlook.com)
   ‚úÖ Yahoo (your-email@yahoo.com)
   ‚úÖ Apple Mail (your-email@icloud.com)
   ‚úÖ ProtonMail (if you have it)
   ```

2. **Test All Email Types:**
   ```bash
   # Welcome email
   curl -X POST "..." -d '{"emailType": "welcome", ...}'

   # Release approved
   curl -X POST "..." -d '{"emailType": "release-approved", ...}'

   # Payment received
   curl -X POST "..." -d '{"emailType": "payment-received", ...}'
   ```

3. **Check Inbox Placement:**
   - Where did the email land?
   - Any warning banners?
   - Images loading correctly?
   - Links working?
