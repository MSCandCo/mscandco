## The Problem

**100 million independent artists worldwide** face critical challenges:

- **💰 Slow Payments:** Industry standard is 3-6 months from stream to payout, creating severe cash flow problems
- **📊 Zero Transparency:** No real-time visibility into earnings, confusing royalty statements, no performance insights
- **💸 High Fees:** Competitors charge $22-$30/year + commissions, with limited features and outdated technology
- **🤯 Complex Process:** Artists juggle multiple platforms, manual processes, and receive no strategic guidance

**Market Impact:** Artists lose thousands in opportunity cost, many quit music careers due to financial instability.
