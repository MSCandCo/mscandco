```

## Onboarding Flow

### Stage 1: Welcome
**Apollo:** "Hey! üëã I'm Apollo, your AI music assistant. I'm here to help you get started with MSC & Co. First things first - what should I call you? What's your artist name or stage name?"

**User:** "Charles Dada"

**Updates:** `has_artist_name = true`, `stage = 'artist_info'`

---

### Stage 2: Artist Info
**Apollo:** "Love it! Charles Dada sounds great! üéµ What genre of music do you create? (e.g., Gospel, Afrobeats, Hip-Hop, R&B, etc.)"

**User:** "Gospel"

**Updates:** `has_genre = true`, `stage = 'contact_info'`

---

### Stage 3: Contact Info
**Apollo:** "Perfect! Now I need a way to reach you if anything important comes up. What's the best phone number to contact you?"

**User:** "+234 123 456 7890"

**Updates:** `has_phone = true`, `stage = 'music_goals'`

---

### Stage 4: Music Goals
**Apollo:** "Almost there! Last question - what brings you to MSC & Co? Are you looking to:
- Distribute your music to streaming platforms
- Track your earnings and analytics
- Grow your fanbase
- All of the above?

Tell me what you're most excited about! üöÄ"

**User:** "I want to distribute my music and track my earnings"

**Updates:** `has_bio = true`, `stage = 'completed'`, `is_completed = true`

---

### Stage 5: Completed
**Apollo:** "That's it! üéâ You're all set up, Charles Dada! Your profile is complete and you now have full access to the platform. Ready to upload your first release or explore your dashboard?"

**Result:** Modal closes, dashboard reloads, full platform access granted

## Component Usage

### In Dashboard
```jsx
import ApolloOnboarding from '@/components/ApolloOnboarding'

<ApolloOnboarding 
  user={user} 
  onComplete={() => {
    setOnboardingComplete(true);
    loadDashboardData();
  }}
/>
```

## Automatic Triggers

### 1. New User Registration
- `initialize_user_onboarding` trigger creates onboarding record
- Automatically sets `stage = 'welcome'`

### 2. First Login
- Dashboard checks onboarding status
- If `is_completed = false`, modal appears
- User cannot access platform until 80%+ complete

### 3. Profile Updates
- Each answer updates `user_profiles` table
- Onboarding progress tracks completion
- Percentage auto-calculates (5 fields √ó 20% each)

## Completion Logic

### Minimum Requirements (80%)
User must complete at least 4 out of 5 fields:
- Artist Name (required)
- Genre (required)
- Phone (required)
- Bio/Goals (required)
- Payment Info (optional)

### Auto-Completion
When `completion_percentage >= 80`:
- `is_completed = true`
- `completed_at = NOW()`
- `stage = 'completed'`
- Modal closes after 2 seconds
- Full platform access granted
