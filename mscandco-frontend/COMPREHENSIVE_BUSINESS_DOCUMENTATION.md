3. Admin approves release
         ↓

```

### Behind the Scenes

**What the Platform Does Automatically:**
- Converts audio files to streaming platform formats
- Generates unique codes (ISRC) for each song
- Sends music to Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.
- Collects streaming data every day
- Calculates earnings based on streams
- Splits money between artists, labels, and collaborators
- Handles taxes and currency conversion
- Sends notifications when money arrives

**What Humans Do:**
- Upload music and artwork
- Fill in song information (title, artist, genre)
- Review and approve releases (admins)
- Make business decisions about pricing and splits

---

## 4. Who Uses This Platform?

### User Types & What They Can Do

#### 1. **Artists** (Basic Users)
- Upload and release music
- See how many people are listening
- Track earnings in real-time
- Withdraw money to bank account
- Update profile and bio
- Respond to label invitations

**Example:** Sarah is a singer-songwriter. She uploads her new single on Monday, it's approved by Wednesday, and by Friday it's live on Spotify. She can see exactly how many people listened each day and how much money she earned.

---

#### 2. **Label Admins** (Managers)
- Manage multiple artists (can oversee 10, 100, or 1,000 artists)
- Invite artists to join their label
- See all releases from their artists
- View combined earnings from all artists
- Approve artist profile changes
- Send messages to artists

**Example:** Mike runs an indie hip-hop label with 50 artists. From one dashboard, he can see all upcoming releases, total label earnings, and which artists are performing best. When an artist wants to update their bank account, Mike gets a notification to approve it.

---

#### 3. **Company Admins** (Business Managers)
- Oversee entire platform operations
- Manage all users and labels
- Approve earnings payouts
- View platform-wide analytics
- Manage subscriptions and billing
- Configure system settings

**Example:** Jennifer manages the business side of MSC & Co. She can see total platform revenue, approve large payouts, and generate monthly financial reports for the board.

---

#### 4. **Super Admins** (Technical & Executive)
- Full access to everything
- Manage user roles and permissions
- Access system logs and performance metrics
- Impersonate users for support (with full audit trail)
- Configure advanced platform settings

**Example:** David is the CTO. When a high-profile artist has an issue, he can "ghost login" as that artist to see exactly what they see and troubleshoot the problem. Every ghost login is logged for security.

---

#### 5. **Distribution Partners** (B2B Users)
- White-label access to distribute through our platform
- View catalog of available music
- Access analytics for distributed content
- Manage revenue sharing

**Example:** A European distributor uses our platform's backend to distribute their artists' music, but their artists see the distributor's branding, not ours.

---

## 5. Key Features Explained

### 5.1 Multi-Brand System

**What It Is:**
One platform can operate as multiple different brands, each with its own look and focus.

**Current Brands:**
1. **MSC & Co** - Premium general music distribution
2. **Audio MSC** - Film, TV, and media licensing focus

**Why This Matters:**
- Target different markets without building separate platforms
- Rebrand for partners (white-label)
- Professional appearance for each brand
- Separate email communications

**Real-World Example:**
Artist A signs up for MSC & Co (gospel music focus) and sees MSC & Co branding everywhere. Artist B signs up for Audio MSC (film licensing) and sees completely different branding and features. Both are using the same platform.

---

### 5.2 Smart Release Management

**What It Is:**
A system that guides artists through uploading music correctly, with quality checks and approvals.

**The Process:**
1. **Upload** - Artist uploads audio files and cover art
2. **Metadata** - Artist fills in song info (title, genre, release date)
3. **Quality Check** - System checks file format, audio quality, artwork size
4. **Review** - Admin reviews for copyright issues or quality problems
5. **Approval** - Admin approves release
6. **Distribution** - Music automatically goes to all platforms
7. **Live** - Song appears on Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

**Safety Features:**
- Can't upload copyrighted material without proof
- Cover art must meet platform standards
- Release dates can't be in the past
- All changes are tracked (audit trail)

---

### 5.3 Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

**What It Is:**
Live charts and graphs showing how music is performing.

**What Artists See:**
- **Stream Count** - How many times each song was played (updates daily)
- **Revenue Chart** - Money earned over time (line graph)
- **Geographic Data** - Which countries are listening (map)
- **Platform Breakdown** - Is Spotify or Apple Music more popular? (pie chart)
- **Trending Songs** - Which of your songs are growing fastest

**What Labels See:**
- All the above, but across all their artists
- Top performing artists
- Label-wide revenue trends
- Comparison between artists

**What Makes It Special:**
- Updates automatically every day (competitors often take weeks)
- Beautiful charts that are easy to understand
- Can export data to Excel for deeper analysis
- Mobile-friendly (check stats on your phone)

---

### 5.4 Wallet System (Game-Changer)

**The Problem with Traditional Music Distribution:**
Artists wait 3-6 months to get paid because:
1. Streaming platforms pay monthly → Distributor (30 days)
2. Distributor processes payment → Label/Artist (60-90 days)
3. Bank transfer → Artist's account (3-7 days)

**Our Solution:**
Every user has a **digital wallet** (like PayPal or Venmo, but built into the platform).

**How It Works:**
1. Artist earns $100 from streams
2. Money appears in wallet **immediately** (same day)
3. Artist can:
   - Withdraw to bank account (2-3 days)
   - Pay for subscription with wallet balance
   - Save for later
   - Transfer to another user

**Wallet Features:**
- **Multi-Currency Support** - See balance in USD, EUR, GBP, or NGN
- **Transaction History** - See every deposit and withdrawal
- **Instant Top-Up** - Add money via credit card (Revolut integration)
- **Security** - Bank-level encryption, two-factor authentication

**Real-World Impact:**
Before: Artist releases song in January, gets paid in May
After: Artist releases song in January, gets paid in February (and can withdraw anytime)

---

### 5.5 Automated Earnings & Royalty Splits

**The Old Way (Manual):**
1. Admin downloads spreadsheet from Spotify
2. Manually calculates each artist's share
3. Types numbers into Excel
4. Initiates bank transfer
5. Hopes no mistakes were made

**Our Way (Automatic):**
1. Platform collects streaming data automatically
2. Computer calculates earnings based on pre-set rules
3. Money is split correctly (even for complex scenarios)
4. Each user sees their exact share
5. Payments are instant

**Complex Split Example:**
Song: "Summer Nights"
- Lead Artist (Sarah): 40%
- Featured Artist (Mike): 20%
- Producer (Alex): 15%
- Record Label: 25%

If the song earns $1,000:
- Sarah gets $400 in her wallet
- Mike gets $200
- Alex gets $150
- Label gets $250

All calculated automatically, no errors, instant deposits.

---

### 5.6 Label-Artist Management

**What It Solves:**
Labels need to manage many artists without chaos.

**Key Features:**

**1. Artist Invitations**
- Label admin sends invite via email
- Artist accepts or declines
- Once accepted, label can see artist's data

**2. Revenue Visibility**
- Label sees all their artists' earnings
- Can drill down to individual artist or song
- Generates financial reports

**3. Approval Workflows**
- Artist wants to change bank account? Label must approve.
- Artist uploads new release? Label can review first.
- Prevents fraud and mistakes

**4. Communication**
- Built-in messaging system
- Label can send announcements to all artists
- Artists can request support

**Real-World Scenario:**
Label has 100 artists. Instead of 100 separate logins and systems, they have ONE dashboard where they can:
- See which artists released music this week
- Approve 3 bank account changes
- Review 5 new releases
- See that Artist #47 is trending and needs marketing support

---

### 5.7 Permission System (Security)

**What It Is:**
Control who can do what on the platform with extreme precision.

**Why It Matters:**
- Prevents unauthorized access to money
- Protects user data
- Allows delegation without risk
- Creates audit trail for compliance

**How It Works:**
Every action requires a "permission" (like a key to a specific door).

**Examples:**

| Action | Who Has Permission? |
|--------|-------------------|
| Upload music | Artists, Labels, Admins |
| Approve earnings payout | Company Admin, Super Admin |
| See all user data | Super Admin only |
| Change user roles | Super Admin only |
| Invite artists | Label Admin, Admins |
| Impersonate users | Super Admin (with audit log) |

**200+ Permissions** covering every possible action.

**Real-World Protection:**
- Label admin can see their artists, but NOT artists from other labels
- Company admin can approve payouts, but can't change user passwords
- Artist can update their own profile, but can't see other artists' earnings

---

### 5.8 Profile Change Request System

**The Problem:**
Artists could accidentally (or maliciously) change their bank account to steal money.

**The Solution:**
Certain changes require **admin approval**.

**Workflow:**
1. Artist tries to change bank account
2. Change is saved as "pending" (not applied yet)
3. Admin gets notification
4. Admin reviews:
   - Is this the artist's real bank account?
   - Does it match their identity?
5. Admin approves or rejects
6. If approved, change takes effect

**Protected Fields:**
- Bank account number
- Legal name
- Tax ID
- Payout settings

**Benefits:**
- Prevents fraud
- Catches mistakes
- Creates paper trail
- Peace of mind for labels
