# UI Formatting Improvements - Permissions & Roles Page

## Summary

Updated the Permissions & Roles management page to display role and permission names with proper capitalization and spacing, making them more user-friendly and professional.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Helper Functions

Created two formatting helper functions at the top of the component:

#### `formatName(name)` - For Role Names
Converts database role names to human-readable format:
- `super_admin` → "Super Admin"
- `label_admin` → "Label Admin"
- `company_admin` → "Company Admin"
- `distribution_partner` → "Distribution Partner"
- Generic handling: `user_access` → "User Access"

#### `formatResourceName(resource)` - For Permission Resources
Converts permission resource names to readable format:
- `*` → "Wildcard (All Permissions)"
- `user_access` → "User & Access"
- `analytics` → "Analytics"
- Multi-part handling with proper capitalization and joining with " & "

### 2. UI Updates

Applied the formatting functions to all UI elements displaying role and permission names:

#### Role Lists
- System roles sidebar
- Custom roles sidebar
- Both now display: "Super Admin", "Label Admin", "Distribution Partner", etc.
- Instead of: "SUPER_ADMIN", "LABEL_ADMIN", "DISTRIBUTION_PARTNER"

#### Permission Groups
- Permission group headers
- Resource names in modals
- Now display: "Analytics", "Messages", "User & Access"
- Instead of: "analytics", "messages", "user_access"

#### Modal Dialogs
- Reset confirmation modal
- Delete role modal
- Create role modal
- All now use properly formatted role names

### 3. Affected UI Elements

**Files Updated:**
- `/pages/superadmin/permissionsroles.js`

**Specific UI Locations:**
1. Line 525: System role display names
2. Line 576: Custom role display names
3. Line 618: Selected role header
4. Line 696: Reset modal role name
5. Line 732: Delete modal role name
6. Line 854: Permission group headers (Create Role modal)
7. Line 964: Permission group headers (Main view)

## Before vs After Examples

### Role Names
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | Super Admin |
| LABEL_ADMIN | Label Admin |
| COMPANY_ADMIN | Company Admin |
| DISTRIBUTION_PARTNER | Distribution Partner |
| ARTIST | Artist |

### Permission Resources
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| analytics | Analytics |
| messages | Messages |
| user_access | User & Access |
| * | Wildcard (All Permissions) |
| settings | Settings |

## Technical Implementation

The formatting is done entirely in the frontend with zero database changes:
- Database still stores `super_admin`, `label_admin`, etc.
- Only the UI display is affected
- No migration required
- No API changes needed
- Fully backward compatible

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: More professional and easier to read
2. **Consistency**: Proper title case throughout the interface
3. **Clarity**: Special cases like "Super Admin" vs "SUPER ADMIN" are immediately recognizable
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized formatting logic in helper functions
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new special cases or modify formatting rules

## Testing

The page has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Permissions page loads without errors
- ✅ Role names display correctly in both system and custom role lists
- ✅ Permission group names display properly formatted
- ✅ Modal dialogs show formatted names
- ✅ All existing functionality works unchanged
- ✅ No performance impact

## Next Steps

Consider applying similar formatting to:
- User management page
- Other admin pages that display role names
- Permission display in user profiles
- Audit logs that show role changes
