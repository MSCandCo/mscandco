# Permission Test Status Summary

## Current Status: ⏸️ BLOCKED - Waiting for Database Migration

### What Just Happened?

I ran the comprehensive permission toggle test again, but **all 66 tests failed** at the first step because the database migration hasn't been applied yet.

### The Problem

The code changes are ready and expect a `denied` column in the `user_permissions` table, but:
- ❌ The `denied` column does NOT exist in the database yet
- ❌ Tests cannot run without this column
- ✅ Code is updated and ready to use the column once it exists

### Verification

Ran `verify-denied-column.js` which confirmed:
```
❌ Error querying user_permissions: {
  code: '42703',
  message: 'column user_permissions.denied does not exist'
}
```

### What You Need To Do

**🎯 MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED**: Apply the database migration in Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vzyhwmvmkkmhyxjmmlnf/sql/new

2. Paste and run this SQL:

```sql
-- Add 'denied' column to user_permissions table
ALTER TABLE user_permissions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS denied BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;

-- Add comment explaining the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN user_permissions.denied IS 'When true, this permission is explicitly denied for the user, even if granted by their role';

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_permissions_denied
ON user_permissions(user_id, denied);

-- Update existing records to explicitly set denied = false
UPDATE user_permissions SET denied = false WHERE denied IS NULL;
```

3. After running the SQL, verify it worked:
```bash
node verify-denied-column.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ SUCCESS: denied column exists!
```

4. Then re-run the comprehensive tests:
```bash
node test-all-permissions-playwright-v2.js
```

### Why This Migration Is Important

The original permission system could:
- ✅ Grant extra permissions to users (beyond their role)
- ❌ **Could NOT revoke permissions that came from roles**

With the `denied` column, the system can now:
- ✅ Grant extra permissions to users
- ✅ **Deny/revoke specific permissions even if the user's role grants them**

### Current Test Results

- **Total Tests Attempted**: 66 (33 permissions × 2 users)
- **Passed**: 0 ✅
- **Failed**: 66 ❌ (all due to missing `denied` column)
- **Reason**: Database column doesn't exist yet

### Files Ready

All code changes are complete and ready:
1. ✅ `/lib/permissions.js` - Updated to handle permission denials
2. ✅ `/pages/api/admin/users/[userId]/toggle-permission.js` - Updated to use denied flag
3. ✅ `/database/migrations/add_permission_denial_mechanism.sql` - Migration SQL ready
4. ✅ Test scripts ready to run

### Next Steps

1. **YOU**: Apply the SQL migration in Supabase (instructions above)
2. **ME**: Re-run tests once you confirm migration is applied
3. **EXPECTED**: All 27 previously failed tests should now pass!

---

**TL;DR**: Tests can't run yet because the database needs the `denied` column. Please run the SQL migration in Supabase, then we can re-run all tests.
