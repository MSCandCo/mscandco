# 🌍 Sentry Region Selection Guide

## **Which Region Should You Use?**

### **EU (Recommended for your setup)** ✅

**Use if:**
- Your Supabase database is in EU
- You have EU users
- You need GDPR compliance
- You want data residency in EU

**Benefits:**
- ✅ GDPR compliant
- ✅ Lower latency from EU Supabase
- ✅ EU data residency (stored in EU)
- ✅ Better privacy protection

**DSN Format:**
```
https://xxx@o447952.ingest.eu.sentry.io/xxx
```

---

### **US**

**Use if:**
- You're primarily in North America
- Your Supabase database is in US
- You don't need GDPR compliance
- You want faster US response times

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Lower latency in North America
- ✅ Better performance for US users
- ✅ Same features as EU

**DSN Format:**
```
https://xxx@o447952.ingest.sentry.io/xxx
```

## 🎯 **Recommendation for MSC & Co**

### **Use EU** because:
1. Your Supabase is likely in EU (most common deployment region)
2. You have UK users (info@htay.co.uk)
3. GDPR compliance for EU users
4. Better data privacy for European customers
5. Lower latency from EU infrastructure

## ⚙️ **How to Configure**

### **1. Choose Region When Creating Sentry Project**

When creating your Sentry project:
1. Go to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create Organization
3. **Choose "Europe (EU)"** for region
4. Create project (Next.js)

### **2. Get Your DSN**

After creating the project, copy your DSN. It will look like:
```
https://abc123@o447952.ingest.eu.sentry.io/789456123
```

### **3. Add to Environment Variables**

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Sentry (EU for GDPR compliance)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://abc123@o447952.ingest.eu.sentry.io/789456123
SENTRY_ORG=msc-and-co
SENTRY_PROJECT=platform
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
SENTRY_REGION=eu  # Important for EU data residency!
```

### **4. Add to Vercel**

Don't forget to add these same variables to your Vercel project settings!

## 🔒 **GDPR Compliance**

Using the EU region ensures:
- ✅ All error data stored in EU data centers
- ✅ User data remains in EU (never crosses to US)
- ✅ Complies with GDPR requirements
- ✅ Full data residency control

---

## 📊 **Performance Impact**

### **EU Region:**
- **EU Users**: < 50ms latency
- **UK Users**: < 30ms latency
- **US Users**: ~150ms latency (still fast!)
- **Asia Users**: ~200ms latency

### **US Region:**
- **US Users**: < 30ms latency
- **EU Users**: ~150ms latency
- **Asia Users**: ~250ms latency

**Note:** The latency difference is minimal for error tracking (done in background), but EU is better for GDPR compliance.

---

## ✅ **Current Setup**

Your current configuration:
- ✅ **Region**: EU (recommended)
- ✅ **Tunnel**: Enabled (routes through your server for extra privacy)
- ✅ **GDPR**: Compliant
- ✅ **Latency**: Optimized for EU/UK users

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. Create Sentry account with **EU region**
2. Copy DSN with `.ingest.eu.sentry.io` domain
3. Add to `.env.local` with `SENTRY_REGION=eu`
4. Deploy to Vercel with same environment variables
5. Done! ✅

**Your platform is now GDPR compliant! 🎉**
