# Billing Page Simplification

## Summary
Simplified the billing page to focus solely on subscription management, removing the separate wallet tab while maintaining wallet top-up functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Tab Navigation**
   - **Before**: Two tabs - "Subscription" and "Wallet"
   - **After**: Single page focused on subscription management
   - Removed `activeTab` state variable
   - Removed tab navigation UI

### 2. **Integrated Wallet Balance Display**
   - Moved wallet balance to the page header
   - **Desktop View**: Shows wallet balance and "Add Funds" button in the top-right corner
   - **Mobile View**: Shows wallet balance and "Add Funds" button in a card below the title
   - Users can still see their balance at a glance

### 3. **Maintained Top-Up Functionality**
   - Kept the top-up modal completely intact
   - Users can click "Add Funds" button to top up their wallet
   - This ensures users can add funds if they don't have enough to subscribe
   - Modal includes:
     - Quick amount buttons (Â£10, Â£20, Â£50, Â£100, Â£200)
     - Custom amount input
     - Payment processing via Revolut

### 4. **Removed Wallet Tab Content**
   - Removed the large wallet balance card
   - Removed the "Recent Transactions" section
   - These features can be accessed elsewhere if needed (e.g., in Settings â†’ Billing tab)

## User Flow

### Before:
1. User goes to `/billing`
2. Sees two tabs: Subscription | Wallet
3. Clicks "Wallet" to manage wallet
4. Clicks "Subscription" to manage subscription
5. Separate views for each

### After:
1. User goes to `/billing`
2. Immediately sees subscription plans
3. Wallet balance visible in header
4. Can click "Add Funds" if needed
5. Everything on one page - cleaner, more focused

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `pages/billing.js`

### State Changes:
```javascript
// Removed:
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('subscription');

// Kept:
const [showTopUpModal, setShowTopUpModal] = useState(false);
const [topUpAmount, setTopUpAmount] = useState(0);
// ... other subscription-related state
```

### UI Changes:
```javascript
// Before:
<nav className="flex space-x-8">
  <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('subscription')}>Subscription</button>
  <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('wallet')}>Wallet</button>
</nav>

// After:
<div className="flex items-center justify-between">
  <div>
    <h1>Billing & Subscriptions</h1>
    <p>Manage your subscription and payment methods</p>
  </div>
  <div className="hidden sm:flex items-center space-x-4">
    <div className="text-right">
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">Wallet Balance</p>
      <p className="text-lg font-bold">Â£{walletBalance.toFixed(2)}</p>
    </div>
    <button onClick={() => setShowTopUpModal(true)}>
      <Plus /> Add Funds
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Benefits

2. **Less Confusion**: No need to switch between tabs
3. **Better UX**: Wallet balance always visible, easy to top up
4. **Maintained Functionality**: Users can still add funds when needed

## Access Points

### Wallet Management:
