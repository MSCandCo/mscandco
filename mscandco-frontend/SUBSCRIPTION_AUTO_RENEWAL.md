# Subscription Auto-Renewal System

## Overview
Automatic subscription renewal system that charges users' wallets when their subscriptions are due for renewal.

## Problem Solved
- **Before**: Subscriptions showed as "overdue" even when users had sufficient wallet balance
- **After**: Subscriptions automatically renew from wallet balance daily

## How It Works

### 1. **Daily Cron Job**
   - Runs every day at midnight (00:00 UTC)
   - Checks all active subscriptions with `auto_renew = true`
   - Processes renewals for subscriptions past their `current_period_end` date

### 2. **Renewal Process**
   For each subscription due for renewal:
   
   **Step 1: Check Wallet Balance**
   - Calculates user's wallet balance from `earnings_log` table
   - Compares with subscription cost
   
   **Step 2a: Sufficient Funds**
   - Deducts subscription cost from wallet (creates negative entry in `earnings_log`)
   - Updates subscription with new period dates
   - Sends success notification to user
   - Subscription remains `active`
   
   **Step 2b: Insufficient Funds**
   - Updates subscription status to `past_due`
   - Increments `renewal_failure_count`
   - Sends notification to user requesting wallet top-up
   - User can add funds and renewal will be attempted next day

### 3. **Notifications**
   
   **Success Notification**:
   ```
   Title: "Subscription Renewed"
   Message: "Your artist_pro subscription has been automatically renewed for ¬£19.99. 
            Next renewal: 24 November 2025."
   ```
   
   **Failure Notification**:
   ```
   Title: "Subscription Renewal Failed"
   Message: "Your subscription renewal failed due to insufficient wallet balance. 
            Please add ¬£15.00 to your wallet to continue your subscription."
   ```

## Files Created

### 1. **Cron Endpoint** (`pages/api/cron/process-renewals.js`)
   - Main renewal processing logic
   - Protected by `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
   - Can be called by Vercel Cron or external cron service
   
   **Security**: Requires `x-cron-secret` header or `?secret=` query parameter

### 2. **Vercel Cron Config** (`vercel.json`)
   ```json
   {
     "crons": [
       {
         "path": "/api/cron/process-renewals",
         "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Runs daily at midnight UTC
   - Automatically configured on Vercel deployment

### 3. **Manual Trigger** (`pages/api/admin/trigger-renewals.js`)
   - Admin endpoint to manually trigger renewals
   - Useful for testing and immediate processing
   - Requires super_admin or company_admin role

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Add Environment Variable**
   Add to `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables:
   ```
   CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-secret-key-here
   ```
   
   Generate a secure secret:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

### 2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   The `vercel.json` file will automatically configure the cron job on deployment.

### 3. **Test Manually** (Development)
   As an admin, trigger renewals manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3013/api/admin/trigger-renewals \
     -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
   ```
   
   Or call the cron endpoint directly:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:3013/api/cron/process-renewals?secret=dev-secret-key"
   ```

## Database Schema Updates Needed

Run this SQL in Supabase to add the required fields:

```sql
-- Add auto-renewal fields to subscriptions table
ALTER TABLE subscriptions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS auto_renew BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_renewal_attempt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS renewal_failure_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS renewal_failure_reason TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS insufficient_funds_notified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_subscriptions_renewal 
ON subscriptions(current_period_end, auto_renew, status);

-- Set auto_renew to true for all active subscriptions
UPDATE subscriptions 
SET auto_renew = true 
WHERE status = 'active' AND auto_renew IS NULL;
```

## User Experience

### For Users with Sufficient Funds:
1. Subscription automatically renews on due date
2. Receives notification: "Subscription Renewed"
3. Wallet balance is deducted
4. Subscription continues without interruption
5. **No action required** ‚úÖ

### For Users with Insufficient Funds:
1. Subscription status changes to `past_due`
2. Receives notification: "Subscription Renewal Failed"
3. Notification shows exact amount needed
4. User adds funds to wallet
5. Next day, renewal is automatically attempted again
6. Once successful, subscription returns to `active`

## Billing Page Display

The billing page will show:
- **Active Subscription**: "Your subscription is active until [date]"
- **Past Due Subscription**: "Subscription Renewal Overdue - Please add funds to your wallet"

The overdue message will only show when there are **insufficient funds**, not when there are sufficient funds available.

## Monitoring & Logs

### Cron Execution Logs
Check Vercel logs or server logs for:
```
üîÑ Starting subscription renewal process...
üìã Found X subscriptions due for renewal
‚úÖ Successfully renewed subscription [id]
‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient funds for subscription [id]
üìä Renewal process complete: { processed: X, successful: Y, failed: Z }
```

### Admin Dashboard
Admins can:
1. View renewal statistics
2. Manually trigger renewals
3. See failed renewal reasons
4. Monitor insufficient fund notifications

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Created cron endpoint with wallet balance checking
- [x] Created Vercel cron configuration
- [x] Created admin manual trigger endpoint
- [x] Handles sufficient funds (auto-renew)
- [x] Handles insufficient funds (past_due status)
- [x] Sends appropriate notifications
- [x] Updates subscription periods correctly
- [x] Deducts from wallet via earnings_log
- [x] Protected by CRON_SECRET

## Next Steps

1. **Add CRON_SECRET to environment variables**
2. **Run database migration SQL**
3. **Deploy to Vercel** (cron will auto-configure)
4. **Test with manual trigger** as admin
5. **Monitor first automated run** (next midnight UTC)

## Future Enhancements

- Grace period (3-7 days) before cancelling subscription
- Email notifications in addition to in-app
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Subscription pause/resume feature
- Payment method fallback (if wallet fails, try card)
- Detailed renewal history dashboard

## Success! üéâ

Users with sufficient wallet balance will now have their subscriptions automatically renewed without seeing "overdue" messages. Only users who actually need to add funds will be prompted to do so.
