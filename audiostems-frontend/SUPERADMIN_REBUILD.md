   - Permission-based quick actions
   - Shows only links user has access to
   - Clean, modern UI
   - Protected with permission checks

2. **`pages/superadmin/permissions.js`** - Permissions & Roles Management

- ✅ Mobile menu with same logic

### **API Endpoints:**
- ✅ `/api/admin/permissions/list` - Working

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **1. Access the Dashboard**
```
http://localhost:3013/superadmin/dashboard
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be logged in
- Must have at least ONE admin permission

**Expected Behavior:**
- Shows quick action cards for features you have access to
- Artists see NO quick actions (redirected to /dashboard)
- Company admins see ALL quick actions
- Custom roles see only relevant quick actions

### **2. View Permissions & Roles**
```
http://localhost:3013/superadmin/permissions
```

**Requirements:**
- Must have `role:read:any` permission

**Expected Behavior:**
- Two tabs: Permissions, Roles
- Permissions tab shows all 132 permissions grouped by resource
- Roles tab shows all 13 roles with their permissions
- Search and filter work correctly
- Click resource/role to expand details

### **3. Test Permission Checks**

**As Artist:**
- ❌ Cannot access `/superadmin/dashboard` (redirected)
- ❌ Cannot access `/superadmin/permissions` (redirected)

**As Company Admin:**
- ✅ Can access dashboard
- ✅ Can access permissions page
- ✅ Sees all quick actions

**As Requests Admin:**
- ✅ Can access dashboard (has `user:read:any`)
- ❌ Cannot access permissions page (no `role:read:any`)
- ✅ Sees limited quick actions

---

## 📝 Code Quality Standards

### **All Pages Must:**
1. ✅ Use `usePermissions()` hook for permission checks
2. ✅ Protect routes with `useEffect` redirect
3. ✅ Show loading states while checking permissions
4. ✅ Handle errors gracefully with retry option
5. ✅ Use `MainLayout` with `showSidebar={true}`
6. ✅ Include clear documentation comments
7. ✅ Follow responsive design patterns

### **No Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ NO role-based checks (`if (role === 'admin')`)
- ❌ NO hardcoded user IDs
- ❌ NO direct database queries from components
- ❌ NO inline permission logic
- ✅ ONLY permission-based checks (`hasPermission()`)
- ✅ ONLY API endpoints for data
- ✅ ONLY reusable hooks and utils

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Implement Role-Permission Assignment**
   - Create UI to assign permissions to roles
   - Build API endpoint for updates
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Test with different roles

2. **Test Phase 1 Thoroughly**
   - Test all permission levels
   - Verify loading states
   - Check error handling
   - Validate UI responsiveness

3. **Document API Endpoints**
   - List all required endpoints
   - Document request/response formats
   - Add error codes and messages

4. **Plan Phase 3**
   - User management requirements
   - UI mockups
   - API endpoints needed
