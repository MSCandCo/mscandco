# üö® CRITICAL WALLET SECURITY FIX

## **THE PROBLEM**

You reported that Apollo AI withdrew money from your wallet:
- ‚ùå Did NOT ask for amount
- ‚ùå Did NOT validate bank details
- ‚ùå Money went... nowhere?
- ‚ùå Header wallet balance went to ¬£0
- ‚ùå Earnings page balance stayed unchanged

**This was a CRITICAL security issue!**

---

## **ROOT CAUSE**

After investigation, I found:
1. **Apollo/Acceber AI system was DELETED** (files not found)
2. **NO withdrawal endpoint exists** in the codebase
3. **Something else** must have modified the balance

The wallet system uses `earnings_log` table as single source of truth. Any negative entry there reduces the balance.

---

## **THE FIX**

### **1. Created Proper Payout Request System**

**New Endpoint:** `/api/wallet/request-payout`

**How it works:**
1. User requests payout with:
   - Amount
   - Bank details (account_name, account_number, sort_code)
   - Optional notes
2. System validates:
   - Amount > 0
   - Bank details complete
   - Sufficient balance
3. Creates a **PAYOUT REQUEST** (status: pending)
4. **ADMIN MUST APPROVE** before money moves
5. Notification sent to user

**NO AUTOMATIC WITHDRAWALS!**

### **2. Created payout_requests Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE payout_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'GBP',
  bank_details JSONB NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  requested_at TIMESTAMP,
  approved_at TIMESTAMP,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP,
  approved_by UUID,
  processed_by UUID,
  rejection_reason TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  admin_notes TEXT
);
```

**Status Flow:**
`pending` ‚Üí `approved` ‚Üí `processing` ‚Üí `completed`

Or: `pending` ‚Üí `rejected` / `cancelled`

### **3. Added Security Checks**

- ‚úÖ Bank details validation
- ‚úÖ Balance checking
- ‚úÖ Admin approval required
- ‚úÖ RLS policies (users see only their requests)
- ‚úÖ Audit trail (who approved, when, why)

---

## **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration**

Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```
mscandco-frontend/database/create-payout-requests.sql
```

This creates the `payout_requests` table.

### **Step 2: Check for Unauthorized Withdrawals**

Run this in Supabase:
```
mscandco-frontend/database/check-wallet-transactions.sql
```

This will show:
- Your current balance
- All recent transactions
- Any negative transactions (withdrawals)
- Your user_profiles wallet_balance

### **Step 3: Fix Any Unauthorized Entries**

If you find unauthorized withdrawals in `earnings_log`:

**Option A: Delete them**
```sql
DELETE FROM earnings_log 
WHERE id = 'unauthorized-entry-id';
```

**Option B: Mark as cancelled**
```sql
UPDATE earnings_log 
SET status = 'cancelled' 
WHERE id = 'unauthorized-entry-id';
```

### **Step 4: Deploy to Production**

```bash
cd "/Users/htay/Documents/MSC & Co/mscandco-frontend"
vercel --prod
```

## **HOW USERS SHOULD WITHDRAW NOW**

### **For Users (Future Implementation):**

1. Go to Earnings page
2. Click "Request Payout"
3. Enter:
   - Amount (e.g., ¬£100)
   - Bank details
   - Optional notes
4. Submit request
5. Wait for admin approval (3-5 business days)
6. Money transferred to bank

### **For Admins:**

1. View pending payout requests
2. Verify bank details
3. Check balance is sufficient
4. Approve or reject
5. Process payment manually (bank transfer)
6. Mark as completed

---

## **WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MONEY?**

Based on the system design:

1. **If balance went to ¬£0 in header:**
   - A negative entry was added to `earnings_log`
   - This reduced the calculated balance

2. **If earnings page didn't update:**
   - Possible caching issue
   - Or different calculation method

3. **Where did the money go?**
   - It didn't actually "go" anywhere
   - The balance was just reduced in the database
   - NO bank transfer occurred (no endpoint exists!)
   - The money is still "in the system"

**To recover:**
- Run the SQL checks
- Find the negative entry
- Delete or cancel it
- Balance will restore

---

## **PREVENTING FUTURE ISSUES**

### **1. Disable Apollo Withdrawals**

Apollo should NEVER be able to:
- Withdraw money
- Modify balances
- Create negative entries

If Apollo is re-enabled, ensure it can only:
- ‚úÖ View balance
- ‚úÖ View transactions
- ‚úÖ Request payout (via the new endpoint)
- ‚ùå NOT directly modify earnings_log

### **2. Add Admin Payout Management**

Create admin page at `/admin/payouts` to:
- View all pending requests
- Approve/reject requests
- Track completed payouts
- Export for accounting

### **3. Add User Payout UI**

Create user page at `/artist/payouts` to:
- Request new payout
- View payout history
- Track request status
- Cancel pending requests

## **FILES CREATED**

1. ‚úÖ `/app/api/wallet/request-payout/route.js` - Payout request endpoint
2. ‚úÖ `/database/create-payout-requests.sql` - Database schema
3. ‚úÖ `/database/check-wallet-transactions.sql` - Debugging queries
4. ‚úÖ `WALLET_SECURITY_FIX.md` - This document

---

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. **URGENT: Run the SQL checks** to see what happened
2. **Deploy the fix** to production
3. **Build admin payout management** page
4. **Build user payout request** UI
5. **Test the full flow** before launch
6. **Document for users** how to request payouts

---

## **TESTING THE FIX**

### **Test Payout Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://mscandco.com/api/wallet/request-payout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100,
    "bank_details": {
      "account_name": "Test User",
      "account_number": "12345678",
      "sort_code": "12-34-56",
      "bank_name": "Test Bank"
    },
    "notes": "Test payout request"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payout request submitted successfully. It will be processed within 3-5 business days.",
  "payout_request": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "amount": 100,
    "status": "pending",
    "requested_at": "2025-10-28T..."
  }
}
```
