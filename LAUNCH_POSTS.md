## 🔥 HACKER NEWS POST

**Title:** Show HN: First music distribution platform with MCP (Claude Desktop/Cursor integration)

**Body:**
```
Hi HN! 👋

I built MSC & Co, a music distribution platform for independent artists, and just launched the world's first MCP server for music distribution.

What this means: Artists can now manage their entire music career directly from Claude Desktop or Cursor using natural language.

Examples:
- "What were my Spotify earnings last month?" → Instant answer
- "Create a new single release for 'Summer Vibes'" → Draft created
- "Which platform is paying me the most?" → Analytics breakdown
- "Check my wallet balance" → Real-time balance

The MCP server has 10+ tools covering:
✅ Releases management
✅ Earnings tracking
✅ Analytics & performance
✅ Wallet & payouts
✅ Notifications

We also launched:
🔌 Public API for developers (https://mscandco.com/developers)
🤝 10% recurring affiliate program

This is part of our vision to make music distribution AI-powered and developer-friendly.

Try it:
- npm install -g @msc-co/mcp-server
- Docs: https://github.com/MSCandCo/msc-co-mcp-server
- Platform: https://mscandco.com

Tech stack: Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript, Model Context Protocol

Would love feedback from the community! What other AI integrations would be useful for musicians?

🚀 HUGE NEWS: MSC & Co is now the first music distribution platform with AI integration!

You can now manage your entire music career from Claude Desktop or Cursor.

This changes everything for artists. 🎵

Thread 🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2/10** (The problem)
```
The problem with music distribution?

Too many dashboards. Too many clicks. Too much context switching.

Want to check earnings? Open browser → Login → Navigate → Wait

Want to create a release? Same painful process.

There had to be a better way.
```

**Tweet 3/10** (The solution)
```
So we built the world's first MCP server for music distribution.

Now you can ask Claude:
"What were my Spotify earnings last month?"

And get an instant answer. No browser. No clicks. Just conversation.

Like having a music business assistant in your AI.
```

**Tweet 4/10** (Demo example)
```
Here's what it looks like:

You: "Which platform is paying me the most?"

Claude (using MSC & Co MCP):
"Spotify is your top earner at £847.32 this month (62% of total), followed by Apple Music at £312.45 (23%). Your Spotify streams increased 34% since you posted on Instagram last week!"

🤯
```

**Tweet 5/10** (Features)
```
What can you do with it?

✅ Check earnings by platform & timeframe
✅ View all your releases
✅ Create new releases
✅ Get analytics & streaming stats
✅ Check wallet balance
✅ View notifications
✅ Search releases
✅ And more!

All via natural language.
```

**Tweet 6/10** (How to get it)
```
Getting started is simple:

1. Install the MCP server:
   npm install -g @msc-co/mcp-server

2. Configure in Claude Desktop

3. Get your API key from MSC & Co

Full docs: [GitHub link]

Takes 5 minutes. Works with Claude Desktop & Cursor.
```

**Tweet 7/10** (Developer API)
```
But we didn't stop there.

We also launched a Public API for developers:

🔌 Build apps on top of MSC & Co
📊 Access releases, earnings, analytics
🔐 Enterprise-grade authentication
⚡ Sub-100ms response times

Docs: https://mscandco.com/developers
```

- Apollo AI assistant (already live!)

"What were my Spotify earnings last month?"

And get an instant answer.
